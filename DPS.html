        The Road Not Taken
    </p>

        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
        <br>
        And sorry I could not travel both
        <br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood
        <br>
        And looked down one as far as I could
        <br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgba(77, 30, 1, 0.715);">
    Then took the other, as just as fair,
    <br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,
    <br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    <br>
    Though as for that the passing there
    <br>
    Had worn them really about the same,
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgba(77, 30, 1, 0.715);">
        
And both that morning equally lay
<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.
<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgba(77, 30, 1, 0.715);">
        I shall be telling this with a sigh
        <br>
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:
        <br>
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
        <br>
        I took the one less traveled by,
        <br>
        And that has made all the difference.
